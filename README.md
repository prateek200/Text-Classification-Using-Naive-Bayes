Dataset - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Twenty+Newsgroups

This projects performs -:

1. Test Classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes(already implemented in sklearn).
2. Implement Naive Bayes on my own from scratch for text classification. 
3. Compare Results of my implementation of Naive Bayes with one in Sklearn.
